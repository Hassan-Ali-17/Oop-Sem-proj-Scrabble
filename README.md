# Oop-Sem-proj-Scrabble
This project develops a digital Scrabble game using C++ and the SFML library, replicating the classic word game where players form words on a 15x15 board to score points. The game aims to provide an accessible, interactive experience with automated rule enforcement, word validation, and scoring, including bonus tiles.
